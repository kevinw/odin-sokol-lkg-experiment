a "println" for the screen
project window
	- an easy way to sort all project assets by date added.
	- it's often that i'm importing something and then rigging it up.
render a framebuffer
render a quilt
shadows
sketch out a flowchart for asset generation. do research
try assimp ? automatically convert textures to basis?
animation skinning
shader_meta needs a cleanup. at the very least, start with package-per-shader?
    or should we just go immediately for a more late-binding approach?
goals: make it very easy to say "this value lerps to this other value"

try sokol compute shaders
consider using D3DCOMPILE_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL0 for debug mode in sokol-"Directs the compiler to use the lowest optimization level. If you set this constant, the compiler might produce slower code but produces the code more quickly. Set this constant when you develop the shader iteratively."
render a complex mesh
try compressed textures like the gltf example
compile dependencies with all optimizations

x get shader globals as a struct, parsed by odin, generating a shader file
x add capture mouse via SetCapture/ReleaseCapture so that we detect mouse up events outside the window
