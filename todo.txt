compile dependencies with all optimizations
x get shader globals as a struct, parsed by odin, generating a shader file
goals: make it very easy to say "this value lerps to this other value"

try sokol compute shaders
consider using D3DCOMPILE_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL0 for debug mode in sokol-"Directs the compiler to use the lowest optimization level. If you set this constant, the compiler might produce slower code but produces the code more quickly. Set this constant when you develop the shader iteratively."
sketch out a flowchart for asset generation
render a complex mesh
try compressed textures like the gltf example
